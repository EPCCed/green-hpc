# <span style="color:red">Exercise:</span> What does your work look like?

Excluding any activities involving HPC systems, list the sources of carbon emissions resulting from your work or research.

Can you order this list by size of emission from largest to smallest?

You may have come up with activities from the list below.

- Travel to/from place of work
- Travel and accommodation for conferences, training and meetings
- Use of non-HPC computing resources
  - e.g. laptops/workstations, cloud resources and the internet
- Data storage
- Laboratory work, e.g. chemicals, instruments
- Printed materials, e.g. books, journal articles

Ordering these by size of emission is more difficult and will differ from person to person.

Typically, any sort of flying to conferences or meetings will be the most carbon intensive activity you can undertake through your work.
Whether this is the largest contribution depends on how often you fly.

If you work in a laboratory, that may well be the next highest source of emissions.
<br>Use of a petrol/diesel may also place highly, especially if you have a long commute.

In fact, all activities that we undertake as part of our work (and personal life) produce carbon emissions. While, in an ideal world, we would
be able to reduce emissions from all our activities, we have finite time and effort, and so we need to prioritise based on which reduction strategies
will have the largest impact.

This means that the first step is to estimate the emissions from different activities we are involved in as part of our work, even if the estimate is very rough.
