### Exercise 2.2

# <span style="color:red">Exercise:</span> Positive carbon impacts

Write down the activities that you do as part of your research or work that could be producing *positive* carbon impacts.

Can you order these activites by size of impact, from largest to smallest?

In other words, is it possible to quantify the positive impact so that it could be included in a carbon audit of your work?

You may have come up with the following activities.

- The research or work you are engaged in is developing new innovations and technologies to reduce or eliminate emissions.

- The research or work you are engaged in is providing data that is critical to efforts to quantify climate change and/or net zero strategies.

- You are involved in training, education and/or activities raising awareness of carbon emissions and helping others to reduce their emissions.

- You are developing resources and tools that help others to quantify and reduce their emissions.

Quantifying positive emissions impacts are often even more difficult than quantifying the (negative) emissions we produce through our work.
Nevertheless, this work is critical to understanding how we are helping to meet climate commitments.

For example, attending this course may motivate you to take some action that reduces the emissions associated with your work.

Maybe everyone attending this course resolves to take action to reduce their overall emissions by 2% this year, but this can be difficult for some,
so perhaps only half actually manage to achieve this level of impact. This still means however that overall, we would see a 1% reduction in emissions
for this year per person attending the course.

Further, if we assume that the work emissions per person per year are 6,000 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e, we could estimate that this course saves 60 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e per person attending.
