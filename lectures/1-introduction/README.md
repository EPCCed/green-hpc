# What is Green HPC?

- Green HPC is carbon-efficient use of HPC.
  - patterns of usage that emit the least carbon possible
  - applies also to the construction and decommissioning of a HPC system

- There are three strategies for reducing carbon emissions produced by HPC.

# Breaking Down Green HPC

During this course, we will cover six key areas of green HPC, derived from the principles of
green software engineering.

- **Carbon Efficiency**: Emit the least amount of carbon possible.
- **Energy Efficiency**: Use the least amount of energy possible.
- **Carbon Awareness**: Do more when the electricity is cleaner and do less when the electricity is dirtier.
- **Hardware Efficiency**: Use the least amount of embodied carbon possible.
- **Measurement**: What you cannot measure, you cannot improve.
- **Reducing Emissions**: Understand mechanisms of carbon reduction.

For each area, we'll introduce some new concepts and explain in detail why it is important in terms of the climate,
and how you can apply them on HPC systems.

We will use the [ARCHER2 UK National Supercomputing Service](https://www.archer2.ac.uk) to provide concrete examples of how
the principles can be applied.
