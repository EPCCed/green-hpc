# What is green HPC system use?

Green HPC system use is carbon-efficient HPC system use, meaning it emits the least carbon possible.
Only three activities reduce the carbon emissions associated with HPC system use.

# How to understand green HPC system use

During this course, we will cover 6 key areas of green use of HPC systems
(based on the principles of green software engineering).

- Carbon Efficiency: Emit the least amount of carbon possible.
- Energy Efficiency: Use the least amount of energy possible.
- Carbon Awareness: Do more when the electricity is cleaner and do less when the electricity is dirtier.
- Hardware Efficiency: Use the least amount of embodied carbon possible.
- Measurement: What you cannot measure, you cannot improve.
- Reducing Emissions: Understand mechanisms of carbon reduction.

For each area, we'll introduce some new concepts and explain in detail why it is important in terms of the climate,
and how you can apply them on HPC systems.

We will use the [ARCHER2 UK National Supercomputing Service](www.archer2.ac.uk) to provide concrete examples of how
the principles can be applied.
