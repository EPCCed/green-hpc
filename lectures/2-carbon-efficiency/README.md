# Greenhouse Gases (GHG)

Greenhouse gases constitute a group of gases contributing to global warming and climate change.

- **non-fluorinated gases**
  - carbon dioxide (CO~2~)
  - methane (CH~4~)
  - nitrous oxide (N~2~O)

- **fluorinated gases**
  - hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
  - perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
  - sulphur hexafluoride (SF~6~)
  - nitrogen trifluoride (NF~3~)

In the atmosphere, these gases have different lifetimes and also absorb different amounts of solar energy.

# Global Warming Potential (GWP)

Each GHG has its own GWP that measures the relative potency of a gas as regards global warming.

Carbon dioxode (CO~2~) is taken as the gas of reference and given a 100-year GWP of 1.

For example, on a 100-year timescale, methane has a GWP that is 28 times greater than CO~2~.
The GWP of methane can be therefore be expressed in terms of a carbon equivalence
  - 28 CO~2~e

# Carbon Dioxide Equivalent

The concept of carbon dioxide equivlent allows us to cmpare the global warming potential of
different GHGs.
