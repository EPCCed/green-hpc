# Greenhouse Gases

Greenhouse Gases (GHG) are gases that contribute to global warming and climate change.

- **non-fluorinated gases**
  - carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>
  - methane, CH<sub>4</sub>
  - nitrous oxide, N<sub>2</sub>O

- **fluorinated gases**
  - hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs
  - perfluorocarbons, PFCs
  - sulphur hexafluoride, SF<sub>6</sub>
  - nitrogen trifluoride, NF<sub>3</sub>

In the atmosphere, these gases have different lifetimes and absorb different amounts <br>of solar energy.

# Global Warming Potential

Each GHG has its own Global Warming Potential (GWP) that measures the *relative* potency of a gas as regards global warming.

Carbon dioxide has the lowest warming potential, it is the most abundant and lasts for thousands of years.
For those reasons, CO<sub>2</sub> is used as the reference for all other GHGs.
  - CO<sub>2</sub> has a GWP of 1.

  - <span style="color:gray">CO<sub>2</sub> has a GWP of 1.</span>

For example, over a 100-year timescale, one tonne of nitrous oxide has a global warming impact equivalent to that
caused by 273 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>.

The GWP100 of N<sub>2</sub>O can be expressed in terms of a carbon equivalence, 273 CO<sub>2</sub>e.
  - other abbreviations are sometimes used, CO<sub>2</sub>eq, CO<sub>2</sub>-eq, or simply "carbon".

The concept of **carbon dioxide equivlent** allows us to compare the global warming potential of different GHGs.

# GWP over different timescales

The GWP100 of methane has a carbon equivalence of 28 CO<sub>2</sub>e, but methane has a 10-20 year lifespan.
Hence, the timescale associated with the GWP must be similarly reduced.
  - GWP20 of CH<sub>4</sub> is 84 CO<sub>2</sub>e

If we reduce the timescale under consideration, the GWP will rise for those GHGs that have shorter lifespans
compared to CO<sub>2</sub>.

# Carbon efficiency in HPC

We aim to procure and run our HPC services in a way that minimises carbon emissions.

**HPC systems commonly host research activities that can have a positive impact on emissions, e.g.**
  - running climate models to provide the evidence to justify carbon reduction policies;
  - modelling wind farms and energy storage technologies to gain insights in how to improve real-world efficiency.

The benefits of such activites are difficult to quantify however.

  - redirecting waste heat to reduce the energy needs of homes and businesses,

# <span style="color:red">Exercise:</span> Carbon emissions from HPC systems

What are the sources of carbon emissions that arise from use of HPC systems?



---
# <span style="color:green">Solution:</span> Carbon emissions from HPC systems

You may have come up with the following sources.

- Emissions from electricity generation to power the HPC system.

- Embodied emissions from manufacturing the HPC system components such as processors, memory and storage.

- Embodied emissions from constructing the infrastructure required to house the HPC system.

- Emissions associated with the people working to procure, run and support the HPC system.

# <span style="color:red">Exercise:</span> Positive carbon impacts

Write down the activities that you do as part of your research or work that could be producing *positive* carbon impacts.

Can you order these activites by size of impact, from largest to smallest?

In other words, is it possible to quantify the positive impact so that it could be included in a carbon audit of your work?



---
# <span style="color:green">Solution:</span> Positive carbon impacts

You may have come up with the following activities.

- The research or work you are engaged in is developing new innovations and technologies to reduce or eliminate emissions.

- The research or work you are engaged in is providing data that is critical to efforts to quantify climate change and/or net zero strategies.

- You are involved in training, education and/or activities raising awareness of carbon emissions and helping others to reduce their emissions.

- You are developing resources and tools that help others to quantify and reduce their emissions.

# <span style="color:green">Solution:</span> Positive carbon impacts

Quantifying positive emissions impacts are often even more difficult than quantifying the (negative) emissions we produce through our work.
Nevertheless, this work is critical to understanding how we are helping to meet climate commitments.

For example, attending this course may motivate you to take some action that reduces the emissions associated with your work.

Maybe everyone attending this course resolves to take action to reduce their overall emissions by 2% this year, but this can be difficult for some,
so perhaps only half actually manage to achieve this level of impact. This still means however that overall, we would see a 1% reduction in emissions
for this year per person attending the course.

Further, if we assume that the work emissions per person per year are 6,000 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e, we could estimate that this course saves 60 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e per person attending.
