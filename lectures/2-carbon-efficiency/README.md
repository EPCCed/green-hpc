# Greenhouse Gases

Greenhouse Gases (GHG) are gases that contribute to global warming and climate change.

- **non-fluorinated gases**
  - carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>
  - methane, CH<sub>4</sub>
  - nitrous oxide, N<sub>2</sub>O

- **fluorinated gases**
  - hydrofluorocarbons, HFCs
  - perfluorocarbons, PFCs
  - sulphur hexafluoride, SF<sub>6</sub>
  - nitrogen trifluoride, NF<sub>3</sub>

In the atmosphere, these gases have different lifetimes and absorb different amounts <br>of solar energy.

# Global Warming Potential

Each GHG has its own Global Warming Potential (GWP) that measures the *relative* potency of a gas as regards global warming.

Carbon dioxide has the lowest warming potential, it is the most abundant and lasts for thousands of years.
For those reasons, CO<sub>2</sub> is used as the reference for all other GHGs and given a GWP of 1.

Carbon dioxide has the lowest warming potential, it is the most abundant and lasts for thousands of years.
For those reasons, CO<sub>2</sub> is used as the reference for all other GHGs and given a GWP of 1.

For example, over a 100-year timescale, one tonne of nitrous oxide has a global warming impact equivalent to that
caused by 273 tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>.

The GWP100 of N<sub>2</sub>O can be expressed in terms of a carbon equivalence, 273 CO<sub>2</sub>e.
  - other abbreviations are sometimes used, CO<sub>2</sub>eq, CO<sub>2</sub>-eq, or simply "carbon".

The concept of **carbon dioxide equivlent** allows us to compare the global warming potential of different GHGs.

# GWP over different timescales

The GWP100 of methane has a carbon equivalence of 28 CO<sub>2</sub>e, but methane has a 10-20 year lifespan.
Hence, the timescale associated with the GWP must be similarly reduced.
  - GWP20 of CH<sub>4</sub> is 84 CO<sub>2</sub>e

If we reduce the timescale under consideration, the GWP will rise for those GHGs that have shorter lifespans
compared to CO<sub>2</sub>.

# Carbon efficiency in HPC

We aim to procure and run our HPC services in a way that minimises carbon emissions.

**HPC systems commonly host research activities that can have a positive impact on emissions.**
  - running climate models to provide the evidence to justify carbon reduction policies
  - modelling wind farms and energy storage technologies to gain insights in how to improve real-world efficiency

The benefits of such activites are difficult to quantify however.
