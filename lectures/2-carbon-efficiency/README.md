# Greenhouse Gases (GHG)

Greenhouse gases are gases that contribute to global warming and climate change.

- **non-fluorinated gases**
  - carbon dioxide (CO~2~)
  - methane (CH~4~)
  - nitrous oxide (N~2~O)

- **fluorinated gases**
  - hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
  - perfluorocarbons (PFCs)
  - sulphur hexafluoride (SF~6~)
  - nitrogen trifluoride (NF~3~)

In the atmosphere, these gases have different lifetimes and also absorb different amounts of solar energy.

# Global Warming Potential (GWP)
Each GHG has its own Global Warming Potential (GWP) that measures the relative potency of a gas as regards global warming.

Carbon dioxide (CO~2~) has the lowest warming potential, it is the most abundant and lasts for thousands of years.
For those reasons, CO~2~ is used as the reference for all other GHGs and given a GWP of 1.

For example, over a 100-year timescale, one tonne of nitrous oxide (N~2~O) has a global warming impact equivalent to that
caused by 273 tonnes of CO~2~.

The GWP100 of N~2~O can be expressed in terms of a carbon equivalence, 273 `CO~2~e`.
  - other abbreviations are sometimes used, `CO~2~eq`, `CO~2~-eq`, or simply `carbon`

The concept of **carbon dioxide equivlent** allows us to compare the global warming potential of different GHGs.

# GWP over different timescales

The GWP100 of methane (CH~4~) has a carbon equivalence of 28 CO~2~e, but methane has a 10-20 year lifespan.
Hence, the timescale associated with the GWP must be similarly reduced.
  - GWP20 of CH~4~ is 84 `CO~2~e`

If we reduce the timescale under consideration, the GWP will rise for those GHGs that have shorter lifespans
compared to CO~2~.

# Carbon efficiency in HPC

We aim to procure and run our HPC services in a way that minimises carbon emissions.

HPC systems commonly host research activities that can have a positive impact on emissions.
  - running climate models to provide the evidence to justify carbon reduction policies
  - modelling wind farms and energy storage technologies
  - difficult to quantify however

HPC sites have been managed to benefit the environment
  - redirecting waste heat to reduce the energy needs of homes and businesses
    - the waste energy of the [LUMI supercomputer](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/the-waste-energy-of-lumi-supercomputer-produces-20-percent-of-the-district-heat-of-kajaani-csc-and-loiste-lampo-have-signed-an-agreement/) produces 20 percent of the district heat of the city of Kajaani
  - improving the biodiversity of surrounding land
