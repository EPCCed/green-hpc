# HPC Carbon IntensityGreenHPC

# HPC-CI specification

The definition\, application\, and calculation of the HPC Carbon Intensity \(HPC\-CI\) is heavily inspired by the Software Carbon Intensity \(SCI\) from the Green Software Foundation\.

HPC\-CI is a methodology to calculate your emissions from HPC system use and to encourage action towards eliminating emissions\.

This is not a replacement for the GHG protocol\, but an additional metric to help you understand how your HPC system use can be measured in terms of carbon emissions\, and thus help you make informed decisions\.

The GHG protocol and the HPC\-E calculate  __total emissions__ \, HPC\-CI is for calculating the  __rate of emissions__ \.

In automotive terms: GHG/HPC\-E is like total carbon footprint of a car manufacturer and all the cars they produce every year\, while HPC\-CI is like miles per gallon\.

It is important to note that it is not possible to reduce your HPC\-CI rate by purchasing offsets in the form of neutralisations\, compensations\, or by offsetting electricity in the form of renewable energy credits\.

This means any HPC system use that makes no effort toward reducing emissions but spends money on carbon credits cannot reduce the associated HPC\-CI rate\.

Offsets are an essential component of any climate strategy; however offsets are not eliminations\.

If you make your HPC use more  __energy efficient__ \,  __hardware efficient__ \, or  __carbon aware__ \, your HPC\-CI rate will decrease\. Investing time or resources into one of these three principles is the only way to reduce the HPC\-CI rate\.

# The HPC-CI equation

The HPC\-CI is a rate rather than a total and measures the intensity of emissions according to the chosen functional unit\.

The specification currently does not prescribe the functional unit; you are free to pick whichever suits the output from your use of HPC systems best\.

For example\, this could be a metric from the software you use \(ns simulated\, number of years simulated\, iterations\) or a metric tied to research progress \(number of compounds modelled\, data points analysed\, papers published\)\.

Imagine you are simulating the dynamics of a biomolecular system \(using software such as GROMACS\, Amber\, or NAMD\)\, then you might want to choose number of ns simulated as your unit\.

You can use multiple functional units to have multiple HPC\-CI values\, each of which may be more useful than others in different contexts\.

# The HPC-CI equation – 6. Calculate HPC-CI rate

* Now you have both the total emissions for your use of HPC systems\, and the number of functional units arising from the same use of HPC systems you can calculate HPC\-CI by dividing the total emissions by the total number of functional units\.
* Continuing the biomolecular simulation\, let’s say the total emissions from our HPC system use is 1500 kgCO2e\, and the total number of functional units are 950 ns simulated:
  * HPC\-CI = 1500 / 950 = 1\.58 kgCO2e/ns
* As well as a tool to help quantify HPC system use\, HPC\-CI can be used to project emissions from HPC system use for future or planned projects\. Many funding bodies are starting to ask for emissions estimates as part of the submission process\.

# Exercise: HPC-CI rate

* In the previous exercise we computed the total HPC system emissions for 3 months of project use to be 14\,84 kgCO2e\. The project was modelling the climate and managed to simulate 3\,680 years of Earth’s climate during that 3 month period using 1100 GPUh of resource\.
  * What is the HPC\-CI in kgCO2e per simulated year?
  * What is the HPC\-CI in kgCO2e per GPUh?

# Exercise solution: HPC-CI rate

Given by 14\,184 kgCO2e / 3680 simulated years = 3\.85 kgCO2e / simulated year\.

Given by 14\,184 kgCO2e / 1100 GPUh = 12\.89 kgCO2e/GPUh\.

# Key Points

The GHG protocol is a metric for measuring an organisation’s total carbon emissions and is used by organisations all over the world\.

The GHG protocol puts carbon emissions into three scopes\. Scope 3\, also known as value chain emissions\, refers to the emissions from organisations that supply others in a chain\. In this way\, one organisation’s scope 1 and 2 will sum up into another organisation’s cope 3\.

You can use the GHG protocol to estimate your emissions from HPC system use but it requires access to reasonable quality information from the HPC systems you are using\.

The HPC\-CI is a metric designed specifically to calculate emissions from HPC systems and is a rate rather than a total\. This can be used to measure improvements in emissions efficiency and drive reductions in emissions\.
